# Memory-Game-in-Python
A Pygame Mini Project

Python is one of the easiest globally used programming languages, and using the pygame modules with it will give you a chance to easily implement many game applications. Pygame is an open free source that you can download later easily. The game we are about to implement is a fairly common game: we have some cards face down and we turn them face up two by two, trying to pair them up. If we manage to turn a pair face up, we remove those two cards from the table. If the cards don't match, we turn them face down again.

=> Consists of even number of tiles.
=> Has 4 shapes :        1. Square        2. Diamond       3. Triangle       4.  Circle
=> 4 colours :        1. Blue        2. Green       3. Red       4. Yellow 


We have implemented this memory game for the following benefits:
Memory games exercise the brain, making it more sharp and alert. If you play memory games at least thirty minutes every day, your concentration and focusing ability will improve.
Memory games have been shown to help prevent some memory-related illnesses, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
Memory games enhance other brain functions, such as attention level, and reading and reasoning skills.
